# Project Progress

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Core libraries integrated:
  * Display (Adafruit GFX + SH110X)
  * Web Server (ESPAsyncWebServer)
  * Data Processing (SimpleKalmanFilter)
- ✅ Migrated IoT Platform from Blynk to MQTT (in progress)
- ✅ Memory Bank initialized

## Pending Analysis
- 📝 Main application code review
- 📝 Data configuration assessment
- 📝 Web interface implementation details
- 📝 Sensor integration specifics
- 📝 OLED display layout and usage

## Next Development Areas
1. Implement MQTT client in `src/main.ino`.
2. Replace all Blynk-related code with MQTT functionality.
3. Update OLED display logic for MQTT status.
4. Test MQTT connectivity and data publishing.
5. Code documentation review.
6. System architecture validation.
7. Error handling assessment.
8. Performance optimization opportunities.
9. Feature completeness verification.

## Progress Estimate
- Initial Setup: 100%
- Code Analysis: 0%
- Documentation: 50%
- MQTT Migration: 10%
- Memory Bank: 100%
- Overall Progress: ~40%

## Notes
- Initial memory bank setup complete
- Need to analyze main application code for detailed progress assessment
- Further updates will be made as code analysis progresses
